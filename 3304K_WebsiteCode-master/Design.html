											<h2>STEP by STEP</h2>
											<p>The Approach</p>
										</header>
										<section>

												<h3>BRAINSTORM</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
												At the beginning of the season, our team sets aside a couple of weeks to meet, and brainstorm design ideas by analyzing
												the game, and looking over the rules. We normally take a look at the scoring breakdown, and the game objects in order to 
												figure out which design will be most compatible, and smooth with the game objects. We then decide on a specific strategy 
												we would like to implement,  and a list of mechanisms we want for the robot. 
										</p>
                                        <p>
												We then protoype these designs separately, with a chosen strategy in mind. We build these mechanisms separately with the 
												objective to see whether they fit our purpose, and the strategy we have in mind. If not, then the ideology has to be 
												changed. 
										</p>
										<p>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>BUILD</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Using the protoypes that worked most successfully, we build a basic robot using the robot designs that we had previously 
												decided on. This robot is not a competition bot, but is rather just a beta testing bot, which we use to run the mechanisms
												and view how successfull they are once it gets to real time situtations. Although we might take it to early season 
												competitions, this is not our fully functioning final robot. We use this robot to build off of, and see where major fixes 
												must be implemented. This step is vital, as it gives us the knowledge we require to make changes to the smaller issues before 
												they develop. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Finally, we take this beta testing robot, and take the improvements that can be made to build a fully functioning competition 
												robot. We do this using V5 motors, and the unproblematic mechnisms that we developed during earlier stages. This gives us the 
												'first iteration robot', which we will not only build on, but will use for competition. 
											</p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>IMPROVE</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												From here, we make continuous changes and improvements based on where we faltered during competition, and where we
												believe we could've done better. This may mean smaller tweaks, such as the replacement of motors, or addition of 
												a major component, such as an arm, or intake. For example, if we realize that the foundation, and fundamentals of 
												our robot are flawed in any way, rebuild and redesign would be the best option. This doesn't necessarily mean we 
												return to where we started, but rather we continue to build on prior ideas, as we already have a good understanding 
												of the game, and objectives by this point.
