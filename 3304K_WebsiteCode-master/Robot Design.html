											<h2>Our Robot</h2>
											<p>HOW WE DESIGNED IT</p>
										</header>
										<p>
                      Our robot is designed primarily to be a tray bot, which focuses on cubes as its scoring focal point. To do this, 
                      our robot consists of a tray mechanism mounted on our 4 wheel, 4 motor drivetrain. Although this tray can hold up 
                      to 9 cubes, we focus on going for more stacks of 7 or 8 during matches to play safe. Attached to the tray mechanism 
                      is our intake, consisting of two sprockets chained together for tension, and rubber bands added from standoffs 
                      for extra tension, in order to keep the cubes in. We use V5 motors for all our mechanisms, as not only is the 
                      system more compatible and easier to access, but it provides us with the ease and speed necessary to function across 
                      the field. 
                    </p>

                      <h3>Drivetrain</h3>
                    </header>
										<p>
                      Our drivetrain is the base of our robot, and the primary component. It consists of 4 wheels, and 4 motors in order 
                      to ensure agility and mobility across the field. We use sprockets to chain the wheels together, which gives us more 
                      control while moving about the field. Each motor is set to 200 rpm, which is the maximum speed each could run at. We 
                      also consist of an anti-tip mechanism in the back, to keep robot from losing balance, which is contractible using the 
                      tension of rubber bands. Spacing was a major difficulty, as it couldn't be too tight or else frriction with the wheel
                      would be a problem, but if it was too loose, then the wheel being unstable would become a major problem come match time.
                      We decided to use a 4 motor drivertrain to power the wheels. The drivetrain is a Tank Drive like design, which utilizes
                      2-4 wheels (in our case omni wheels), and is power by a desired amount of motors (4 in our case). This is the most common
                      drivetrain in Robots, as it helps with increased maneauverability.The only disadvantage to this drivetrain, is its 
                      disability to strafe, which we don't really value in this competition format.

												<h3>Tray Mechanism</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
                        The primary purpose of the tray mechanism is to pick up cubes. Although the design looks more like an elevator lift, 
                        it uses pressure and tension to creat a stack of cubes, which in our case is about 7-8 cubes average (could be 9). Our
                        tray is folded in three times to keep us in size, and when match time comes, the pressure of the cubes, and the releasing 
                        tension of rubber rbands will help it unfold into an elevator-like mechanism. The tray is tilted at about a 65Â° angle, to 
                        accomodate cubes that are pushed in through the intake. The standoffs at the top of the tray represent the stopping point
                        of the cubes, where there is ensurement that mechanism is stable. 
                      </p>
                      <header>
												<h3>Intake</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
                        This design came with multiple challenges. Our intake is 4 sprockets, two on each side, chained together with little flaps, 
                        to produce the income of cubes. Although that might sound simple, there were obstacles. The tension through rubber bands had 
                        to be perfect, so the intake doesn't bend inward too much, or let loose too much. In both these scenarios, the cubes could either
                        get stuck in our tray mechanism, or simply fall out. Secondly, our intake wasn't strong enough to push cubes up levels 
                        of the tray mechanism. The intake kept splaying, not allowing the cubes to settle in one place. Due to this, the tray would make 
                        gunfire noises when moving up and down because the gears would be meshing with the metal. We used a 1:1 gear ratio on the intake 
                        to ensure constant speed, but we are thinking of changing that iteration to increase torque and speed, and increase the smoothness
                        at which it intakes. We also had to find the right angle of the intake, in order to help the cubes into the tray. This caused us to
                        rebuild the design multiple times, as we had to change the position of the hinge attaching it to the tray, and we had to change 
                        the number of zipties on the chain in order to increase grip.

												<h3>Driving Strategy</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
                      In our opinion, the most effective game strategy is for our team to focus on scorring cubes in the scoring zone during Driver 
                      Control, as well as place cubes in the towers, as our mechanisms (tray, and multi portion intake) are meant to produce those 
                      objectives. We prefer being allianced with tower bots, as we could focus on scoring cubes in the scoring zones of a particular 
                      color, while they could work on multiplying that color for maximum results. For the autonomous period, we are focused on creating 
                      multiple programs for each part of the field, so we are prepared and can adjust to our alliance's preferences if necessary. We must 
                      have a support auton and a primary auton for each color.
